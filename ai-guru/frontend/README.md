### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** installed
- **Backend running** on http://localhost:8001
- **Internet connection** for AI API calls

### Installation & Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
üåê **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** to view it in your browser.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**Production features:**

- Optimized bundle size for faster loading
- AI learning system fully functional
- All 50+ languages supported
- Professional disclaimer included
- Mobile-optimized interface

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## üß† AI Learning Integration

### Feedback System

The frontend includes interactive elements that help train the AI:

- **üëç üëé Feedback Buttons**: Users can rate AI responses to improve future interactions
- **Learning Analytics**: Real-time feedback is sent to backend for pattern analysis
- **Adaptive UI**: Interface learns user preferences for response formats
- **Session Memory**: Conversations maintain context for natural dialogue flow

### Multilingual Support

- **Language Detection**: Frontend works seamlessly with backend language detection
- **Mixed Languages**: Supports Hinglish, Tenglish, and other code-switching patterns
- **Cultural Adaptation**: UI adapts to different cultural communication styles
- **RTL Support**: Ready for right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.)

### Professional Features

- **AI Disclaimer**: Transparent disclosure that users are interacting with AI
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and network issues
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly with proper ARIA labels
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and smooth interactions

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
